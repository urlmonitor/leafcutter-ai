# KI-ACD-005 — User approval gates are dispatched to a `status-checker` agent, whose out-of-scope refusal is parsed as "the user chose cancel"

> One known issue, split out of `docs/known-issues/ac-driven-dev.md` on
> 2026-09-14. Index: [ac-driven-dev.md](../ac-driven-dev.md).
> Filename severity is the three-level index bucket (`blocker`); the
> original grading is the `**Severity:**` line below, unchanged.

- **Severity:** blocker
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `templates/workflows-js/plan-feature.js` — the PT-phase approve/edit/cancel gate (`pt-gate-mockdata`); `resolveGate()` / gate answer parsing

**Symptom.** The gates that the skill documents as *user* decision points are not
presented to a user at all. They are dispatched as prompts to a `status-checker` agent.
That agent — correctly — replies that approving product-truth artifacts is not its job.
Its reply is then parsed as a gate answer of `action: cancel`, and the pipeline
discards the run. **No human was involved at any point.**

**Evidence.** The final agent result in the run journal for `wf_1969bd0b-43f`:

```json
{"action": "cancel",
 "feedback": "This request is outside status-checker's defined scope (ticket-state
  verification and closing per docs/agents/conventions.md). status-checker has no
  defined process for reviewing or approving mock-data-author's product-truth
  artifacts, and no ticket_path or sign-off context was provided for this dispatch.
  Recommend routing this approval gate to the agent/role actually responsible for
  product-truth review ... not status-checker."}
```

The agent diagnosed the defect and named the fix in its own refusal.

**Why this is worse than a hang.** A gate that cannot reach a user should **pause and
persist** a resumable state. Instead the failure mode resolves to `cancel`, which is the
one answer that throws work away. Any agent reply the parser cannot map to
`approve`/`edit` becomes a destructive default.

**Fix direction.** Gates must not be answered by an agent. Either surface them to the
real user, or persist a pause record and exit with a status that says "awaiting input"
— and re-enter via `args.resume_answer`, which the script already supports (ADR-024).
Separately, harden the answer parser: an unrecognised or refusal-shaped reply must
never resolve to `cancel`; fail to `pause`, never to `discard`.
