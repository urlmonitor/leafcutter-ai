# KI-BO-009 — The harness default stub is generically positive, so a new gate silently breaks older fixtures

> One known issue, split out of `docs/known-issues/build-orchestration.md` on
> 2026-09-14. Index: [build-orchestration.md](../build-orchestration.md).
> Filename severity is the three-level index bucket (`low`); the
> original grading is the `**Severity:**` line below, unchanged.

- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 3
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `unit_tests/_workflow_engine_harness.py` — the default reply for an
  agent label the caller did not stub

**Symptom.** When a caller does not stub a label, the harness answers with a generic
`{status: "ok", passed: true, ...}`. Every fixture written before a new mandatory
gate exists therefore fails to stub it. Because well-built gates fail **closed** on a
reply that lacks their own schema field, the run halts early and every later
assertion in that fixture fails — with a message about the wrong phase entirely.

**Evidence.** Three times in one day, adding a gate to `fast-lane-ship.js` broke
fixtures authored before it: `fastlane-review` and `fastlane-changelog` (KI-BO-001),
then `fastlane-context-bundle` (BO-2400c-1-iii), which broke 10 tests across two
files. The repair each time is one dict entry per fixture — mechanical, but only
once you recognise the shape.

**Why it is more than churn.** The default is generically *positive*, so the cheapest
way to make the suite green again is to widen the new gate to accept `passed: true`
as a pass. That is what happened on the first occurrence: a `|| result.passed === true`
clause was added to two guards, which in production would have let a reply carrying
no verdict at all count as a clean review — the exact defect the criterion existed to
prevent. It was removed and the fixtures corrected instead. The pull toward that fix
is a property of the harness, not of the agent that reached for it, and it will recur.

**Fix direction.** Prefer making the default reply *inert* rather than positive — an
empty object, or one that carries no field any gate reads as success — so an
unstubbed gate fails closed loudly and obviously instead of tempting a guard to widen.
That is a change with blast radius across every existing fixture, so it needs its own
AC and a sweep, not a drive-by. Until then: when adding a gate to a workflow, grep
`unit_tests/workflows/` for other fixtures driving the same workflow and add the stub
to each in the same change — and never widen the gate to accept the default's shape.
