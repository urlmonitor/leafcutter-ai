# KI-BO-008 — A structural test makes code comments load-bearing

> One known issue, split out of `docs/known-issues/build-orchestration.md` on
> 2026-09-14. Index: [build-orchestration.md](../build-orchestration.md).
> Filename severity is the three-level index bucket (`low`); the
> original grading is the `**Severity:**` line below, unchanged.

- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `unit_tests/workflows/test_fast_lane_ship_structure.py` —
  `test_ac10_release_invoked_on_failure_abort_branches`

**Symptom.** The test finds the first occurrence of the substring `release` in
`fast-lane-ship.js` and asserts it sits within 2000 characters of a `return {`. Both
halves are text heuristics over source, so any **comment** containing the word
`release` — anywhere earlier in the file than the real release dispatch — fails the
test, regardless of what the code does.

**Evidence.** During the KI-BO-001 work a new comment referencing
`scripts/release/check_changelog_presence.py` moved the first `release` match far from
any return block and broke the test. The fix was to reword the comment — the
implementation was already correct. A test that can be satisfied or broken by prose is
constraining the wrong thing.

**Fix direction.** Re-author it as a behavioural assertion, like the newer suites in
`test_bo2400f_review_and_delivery_guarantee.py`: run the workflow under
`unit_tests/_workflow_engine_harness.py` with a failing phase stubbed and assert a
release dispatch is actually recorded on that path. Note this whole file is the
pre-behavioural grep-based generation; `BP-1100b-5` already exists to reject newly
added presence-only assertions, so this is the existing stock, not a new violation.
Worth doing when that file is next touched rather than as its own errand.
