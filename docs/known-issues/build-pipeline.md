# Known issues — build-pipeline

Observed defects in this component that are **not yet fixed**. This file exists so a
defect noticed in passing can be recorded in seconds, without authoring a full
acceptance criterion for something nobody has decided to build yet.

## How to use this file

**Read it before adding new capability to this component.** Fixing what is already
broken takes precedence over building more.

**Adding an issue.** Append a new `### KI-BP-NNN` section using the next free number.
Nothing here is generated — edit it by hand. Fill in what you actually know; an issue
recorded with a thin `Evidence` line is far better than one not recorded.

**Hitting an existing issue.** Increment `Occurrences` and update `Last seen`. Do not
add a duplicate entry. Occurrences is an escalator, not the score — a blocker seen once
outranks an annoyance seen ten times.

**Severity** is `blocker` (work cannot land) / `high` (silent wrong behaviour) /
`medium` (real but survivable) / `low` (noise, dead code, cosmetics).

**Closing an issue.** When the fix lands, delete the section and reference the issue id
in the commit message. If it earns real work, author an AC for it and note the AC id in
`Status` — this file is a capture surface, not a replacement for the AC store.

### KI-BP-001 — The documented self-host build command destroys `docs/INDEX.md` on every run

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 4
- **First seen:** 2026-08-17 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/build.py` — the Doc-index phase (`generate_doc_index.py`,
  `repo_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` default)

**Symptom.** `python leafcutter-ai/scripts/build.py --target-dir .` run from the
workspace parent — the exact command `CLAUDE.md` documents, and what `./build-self.sh`
runs — regenerates the doc index **from the workspace parent** (which has no `docs/`
tree) while **writing into the source repo** at `leafcutter-ai/docs/INDEX.md`. The build
prints `✓ wrote leafcutter-ai/docs/INDEX.md` and the file is replaced with `No docs
found.` in all nine sections.

The write target and the scan root disagree: it scans the deploy target and writes to
the package. Deploying into the repo root instead leaves the tree clean, which is why
this is invisible to consumer installs and only bites self-hosted development.

**Evidence.** Reproduced four times across two sessions. Each run leaves exactly
`docs/INDEX.md | 183 ++-----` — 11 insertions, 172 deletions — as the sole working-tree
modification, on an otherwise clean tree. Reverted with `git checkout -- docs/INDEX.md`
each time. Initially misdiagnosed as another author's stray commit before the build was
caught doing it in the act.

**Fix direction.** Resolve the doc-index scan root and the write target from the same
base. Either scan the package repo when writing into it, or write into the target
directory it scanned — but not one of each. Until then, `git checkout -- docs/INDEX.md`
after any self-host build, and never stage `docs/INDEX.md` from a build run.

**Trap.** Because the corruption is a *tracked file modification* produced by a routine
build, it is easy to commit by accident in a `git add -A` sweep — and easy to blame on a
concurrent author, since it appears in a tree you did not knowingly edit.
