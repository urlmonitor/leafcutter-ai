# KI-CG-005 — `check-product-truth-validate` / `check-product-truth-generate` hard-fail on an absent, explicitly optional product-truth store, gating every AC YAML commit

> One known issue, split out of `docs/known-issues/commit-guardian.md` on
> 2026-09-14. Index: [commit-guardian.md](../commit-guardian.md).
> Filename severity is the three-level index bucket (`blocker`); the
> original grading is the `**Severity:**` line below, unchanged.

- **Severity:** blocker
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `templates/scripts/commit_guardian/commit_guardian.json:986` (`check-product-truth-validate`) and `:999` (`check-product-truth-generate`)

**Symptom.** Both hooks declare `files: "(^docs/product-truth/|^docs/acceptance-criteria/.*\\.yaml$)"`,
so they fire on **any staged AC YAML**, not only on product-truth artifacts, and both invoke
scripts living under `docs/product-truth/scripts/` (`validate_product_truth.py`,
`generate_product_truth.py`). `check-product-truth-validate`'s own `_comment` states the
posture plainly: *"jsonschema is a HARD dependency (validator exits 2 if absent — never a
silent no-op)."* But the product-truth store is **opt-in** — the `/plan-feature` skill
documents the intended behaviour on its absence: *"When the product-truth store is absent
the PT phase self-skips non-silently and AC authoring still proceeds"* (AC UXP-595a). The
defect is the disagreement between these two, not either half on its own: the workflow is
explicitly designed to degrade gracefully when the store is absent, and the hooks treat that
same absence as a hard failure. A consumer who never opted in cannot commit *any* AC YAML —
the optional feature's absence gates the mandatory one.

**Evidence.** Reported by a consumer project (DIAGraph) on 2026-08-18. Their
`docs/product-truth/` directory exists only because `build.py` deploys schemas and scripts
into it; zero of their docs reference the feature and they never opted in. They had been
running `/plan-feature` without the PT phase throughout, exactly as designed — and were then
blocked from committing by these two hooks the first time an AC YAML was staged.

**Relationship to KI-CG-002.** Same root shape as KI-CG-002 above: a guard behaving badly
when a file or store it depends on is not present. KI-CG-002 silently swaps its enum source
for a second one on that absence; this pair fails loudly and totally on it — but in both
cases the guard never asked "is my dependency supposed to be here?" before acting on its
absence.

**Fix direction.** The fix is not "add a guard to the hook" in isolation — the workflow
already encodes the decision that product-truth is optional. Make the hooks agree with it:
skip when the store is absent, the same way the workflow does. Pick one answer to "is this
optional?" and have both halves honour it.
