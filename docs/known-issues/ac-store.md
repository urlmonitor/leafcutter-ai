# Known issues — ac-store

Observed defects in this component that are **not yet fixed**. This file exists so a
defect noticed in passing can be recorded in seconds, without authoring a full
acceptance criterion for something nobody has decided to build yet.

## How to use this file

**Read it before adding new capability to this component.** Fixing what is already
broken takes precedence over building more.

**Adding an issue.** Append a new `### KI-ACS-NNN` section using the next free number.
Nothing here is generated — edit it by hand. Fill in what you actually know; an issue
recorded with a thin `Evidence` line is far better than one not recorded.

**Hitting an existing issue.** Increment `Occurrences` and update `Last seen`. Do not
add a duplicate entry. Occurrences is an escalator, not the score — a blocker seen once
outranks an annoyance seen ten times.

**Severity** is `blocker` (work cannot land) / `high` (silent wrong behaviour) /
`medium` (real but survivable) / `low` (noise, dead code, cosmetics).

**Closing an issue.** When the fix lands, delete the section and reference the issue id
in the commit message. If it earns real work, author an AC for it and note the AC id in
`Status` — this file is a capture surface, not a replacement for the AC store.

### KI-ACS-001 — `validate_ac_schema.py` exits 0 when it validates nothing

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py:333`

**Symptom.** The script takes **file paths** and does no globbing of its own. Handed a
directory — the intuitive way to validate a component — it matches zero files, prints
`No YAML files to validate.` and **exits 0**. The caller sees a success-shaped result
from a run that checked nothing. A validator that cannot distinguish "clean" from "I was
given nothing" is worse than no validator, because it is consulted for reassurance.

**Evidence.** Verified 2026-08-18 against `docs/acceptance-criteria/testing-quality/`:
the bare-directory form prints the no-op message and exits 0, while
`find <dir> -name "*.yaml" -exec python scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py {} +`
over the same tree reports eight real violations (`documentation_triggers` present on L2
records, permitted only on L1). Across the whole store the correct invocation reports
**288** violations, most of them legacy list-form `it_requirements` predating the
object-form rule — real, but not a fire.

This mattered because `CLAUDE.md`'s own "AC-store hygiene — bulk pre-flight" section
prescribed the bare-directory form from 2026-08-10 until 2026-08-18, so the documented
defence against store rot was itself a no-op for eight days. That instruction is now
fixed; the script is not.

**Fix direction.** Exit non-zero, or at minimum warn loudly, when the resolved file count
is zero. Better: accept a directory and walk it, since that is plainly what every caller
means. Note a plain `*/*.yaml` glob is **not** an adequate workaround — AC YAML sits at
more than one depth, so a fixed-depth pattern silently skips directories, which is the
same defect wearing a different hat.

**Pattern:** `docs/reference/false-green-mechanisms.md` → M5.

### KI-ACS-002 — `--verify` passes `files_touched` on a path count, not on correctness

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/generate_ticket_from_ac.py` — the `--verify` readiness report

**Symptom.** The readiness report's surface check asserts only that *some* paths were
derived. Its output reads `[PASS] files_touched has N path(s) from doc_links` — N > 0 is
the whole test. An AC whose derived surface omits the file the work changes, and includes
a file the AC's own criteria forbid touching, passes it and the report concludes `READY`.
The provenance label is misleading too: paths that came from the prose fallback are
reported as coming from `doc_links`.

**Evidence.** `python scripts/ac_store/generate_ticket_from_ac.py --ac BO-2400g-2 --verify`
on `main` at `439b9076f` exits 0 and prints:

```
=== Ticket readiness report for BO-2400g-2: READY ===
  [PASS] files_touched has 4 path(s) from doc_links
```

The four paths are `scripts/build.py`, `templates/agents/change-scope-reviewer.md`,
`templates/agents/pr-reviewer.md` and `unit_tests/_workflow_engine_harness.py`. The file
that AC exists to change — `templates/workflows-js/fast-lane-ship.js` — is absent, because
its `doc_link` is tagged `describes`. `change-scope-reviewer.md` is a file that AC's
criteria explicitly forbid touching, and `scripts/build.py` came from the prose scan, not
from a `doc_link` at all.

This is the check people reach for when they want reassurance that a generated ticket is
sane, so a count dressed as a verdict is worse here than elsewhere.

**Fix direction.** Compare the derived surface against something independent — at minimum
warn when an AC has edit-surface `doc_links` for files that did not make the list, or when
a path arrived only via the prose fallback. Report provenance per path honestly. A check
that cannot assess correctness should report `INFO`, not `PASS`. Related: the prose
fallback itself is `BP-1100a-4`, and the authoring-side rule is documented in
`docs/how-to/ac-traceability-store.md`.

**Pattern:** `docs/reference/false-green-mechanisms.md` → M8.

### KI-ACS-003 — The store validator does not check id uniqueness, so duplicate AC ids merge clean through a required gate

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py`, and the `AC store valid` CI job that runs it

**Symptom.** `validate_ac_schema.py` validates each file against the schema
independently. It never compares `id` fields across files, so two records sharing an id
both validate and the store reports healthy.

**Evidence.** Run directly against the two files that currently both claim `GE-120` on
`main`:

```
$ python3 scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py \
    docs/acceptance-criteria/guardrail-engine/GE-120.yaml \
    docs/acceptance-criteria/guardrail-engine/GE-120-green-means-checked/GE-120.yaml
OK: all 2 AC YAML files are valid.
```

One is an L2 about the doc-types guard; the other is an L0 with 42 descendants. Same
id, different level, unrelated subjects. See `docs/known-issues/ac-driven-dev.md`
KI-ACD-008 for how the duplicate was created.

**Why it matters more than a normal validator gap.** `AC store valid` is one of the six
**required** status checks on `main`. It is the gate whose entire job is to keep the
store trustworthy, and an id is the store's primary key — every `depends_on`,
`covered_by`, `implemented_by` back-link and every `# covers:` done-proof tag resolves
through it. A duplicated id means those references are ambiguous: a coverage resolver
asked for `GE-120` gets whichever file it happens to read first. Green here currently
means "each file is individually well-formed", not "the store is consistent", and the
name of the check invites the stronger reading.

**This is no longer hypothetical — the ambiguity is producing wrong output today.**
`scan_ac_orphans.py parent-links` over `docs/acceptance-criteria/guardrail-engine/`
**exits 1** reporting five orphans: `GE-120a`, `GE-120b`, `GE-120c`, `GE-120d`,
`GE-120e` "missing from `GE-120.yaml`'s `covered_by`". All five reports are false.
The two records:

```
GE-120-green-means-checked/GE-120.yaml   (L0)   covered_by: [GE-120a..GE-120e]   <- correct
GE-120.yaml                              (L2)   covered_by: []                   <- resolved instead
```

The resolver derived parent `GE-120` from each child id, read the **loose L2**, found
an empty `covered_by`, and declared the children orphaned. The real parent lists all
five correctly. So the duplicate id is already corrupting a store-integrity tool's
verdict — and `check_ac_parent_covered_by` is a commit-time hook resolving parents the
same way, which means the same ambiguity can block a correct commit or wave through an
incorrect one depending only on which file is read first.

That elevates this from "a gap that let a duplicate merge" to "a gap that is actively
producing incorrect results in the tooling built on top of it".

**Fix direction.** Add a store-wide uniqueness pass: collect every `id:` across the AC
root, fail on any id claimed more than once, and name both paths in the error. This is
a whole-store check rather than a per-file one, so it needs a mode that takes the store
root — note the CLI currently accepts **file** arguments only and silently skips
anything that is not a `.yaml`, which is also why a directory argument returns the
misleading `No YAML files to validate.` Worth covering retired ids in the same pass:
the id between GE-118 and GE-120 is recorded as retired and must never be
reissued (see PR #453), which a pure uniqueness check would not catch on its
own. It is not written out here because the GE-122e-1 guard fails the build on
any live citation of it outside dated historical records.

### KI-ACS-004 — An AC is marked `done` with no link to the code implementing it

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open — no AC authored yet; the semantics question below is the reason
- **Occurrences:** 15
- **First seen:** 2026-08-17 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-19
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/mark_ac_done.py`; also reached from
  `scripts/build_orchestration/fast_lane.py` — `_update_ac_work_status`, used by
  `mark_done_built_acs`

**Symptom.** Every automated path to `work_status: done` is status-only. Nothing
writes `implemented_by`, so an AC can assert completion with no traceable link to the
code that satisfied it — the reader has no way to check the claim.

**Evidence.** TKT-600a-1 after its fast-lane build: `work_status: done`,
`implemented_by: []`; populated by hand in `b3124ff25`. Same gap on 2026-08-17 when
the BO-2400a-3 family was marked done via `mark_ac_done.py`, which also only sets
`work_status` — so this is not specific to the fast lane.

Reproduced ten more times on 2026-08-18 (PR #485). Every one of BO-2400f-4, its six
children, BO-2400f-11, and BO-2400c-1-ii/-iii/-iv was marked done through
`mark_ac_done.py --test-root`, passed the coverage gate, and landed with
`implemented_by: []`. All ten were filled in by hand in the same commit. The
count is what makes the shape clear: this is not an occasional miss, it is the
guaranteed outcome of every automated done-transition, and the only thing
currently preventing a store full of unprovenanced dones is somebody noticing.

Three more on 2026-08-19: BO-2600b-1, -1-i and -1-ii, again via
`mark_ac_done.py --test-root`, again all three landing `implemented_by: []` after
passing the coverage gate, again filled in by hand. Recorded not because three more
adds information about the mechanism — it does not — but because the only reason the
count keeps rising instead of the defect being fixed is that hand-repair is cheap
enough each time to stay below the threshold at which anyone stops to fix it. That is
worth being explicit about: the workaround is what is keeping the bug alive.

Worth recording precisely because the gate did its job. Coverage was verified, a
passing covers-tagged test existed for each — so the failure is not "done was
claimed falsely", it is "done was claimed truthfully and left untraceable". It is a
sibling of KI-ACS-001 above rather than a duplicate: that one is a check reporting a
pass it did not earn, this one is a record omitting the evidence for a pass it did.

**Fix direction.** Write `implemented_by` at mark-done time from the evidence already
in hand (the coder phase reports `files_modified`; `done_proof` already resolves the
covering test). Note this is a **provenance-semantics decision, not a mechanical
one** — what `implemented_by` must contain for a claim of done to be trustworthy is
the owning question, and it should be settled here rather than in each call site.

**Provenance.** Originally recorded as KI-BO-002 in
`docs/known-issues/build-orchestration.md` because it was found during a fast-lane
run. Refiled here on 2026-08-18: the call site is in `fast_lane.py`, but the
semantics of `implemented_by` and of what "done" must prove belong to this
component, not to the lane that happens to invoke it. Renumbered twice while this
branch waited to merge — filed as KI-ACS-001, then 003, now 004: `ac-store.md` was
created independently on both sides of the merge, and main kept adding entries
underneath. The id churn is cosmetic; the defect is not.
