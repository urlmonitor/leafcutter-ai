# KI-ACD-006 — A run that authors zero ACs reports `status: "ok"`

> One known issue, split out of `docs/known-issues/ac-driven-dev.md` on
> 2026-09-14. Index: [ac-driven-dev.md](../ac-driven-dev.md).
> Filename severity is the three-level index bucket (`high`); the
> original grading is the `**Severity:**` line below, unchanged.

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `templates/workflows-js/plan-feature.js` — cancellation return path

**Symptom.** The cancelled run returned:

```json
{"status": "ok",
 "message": "Pipeline cancelled at the product-truth gate (mock-data-author).
             No PR was opened. ...",
 "cancelled_at": "pt-gate-mockdata"}
```

`status: ok` for a run that produced no ACs, opened no PR, and left a draft stranded.
A caller that branches on `status` — which is the whole point of returning one — treats
this as success. Verified independently: the authoring worktree
`worktrees/guardrail-engine` had **zero commits** and **zero AC files** afterwards.

**Fix direction.** `ok` should mean "the thing you asked for happened". A cancellation
is `cancelled`; a cancellation nobody asked for is an `error`. This is the same
false-success class as `build-feature` reporting `status: ok` with `skipped_phases: []`
while never opening a PR — see `docs/known-issues/build-orchestration.md` KI-BO-001 for
the sibling shape in the other workflow.
