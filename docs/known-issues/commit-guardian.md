# Known issues — commit-guardian

Observed defects in this component that are **not yet fixed**. This file exists so a
defect noticed in passing can be recorded in seconds, without authoring a full
acceptance criterion for something nobody has decided to build yet.

## How to use this file

**Read it before adding new capability to this component.** Fixing what is already
broken takes precedence over building more.

**Adding an issue.** Append a new `### KI-CG-NNN` section using the next free number.
Nothing here is generated — edit it by hand. Fill in what you actually know; an issue
recorded with a thin `Evidence` line is far better than one not recorded.

**Hitting an existing issue.** Increment `Occurrences` and update `Last seen`. Do not
add a duplicate entry. Occurrences is an escalator, not the score — a blocker seen once
outranks an annoyance seen ten times.

**Severity** is `blocker` (work cannot land) / `high` (silent wrong behaviour) /
`medium` (real but survivable) / `low` (noise, dead code, cosmetics).

**Closing an issue.** When the fix lands, delete the section and reference the issue id
in the commit message. If it earns real work, author an AC for it and note the AC id in
`Status` — this file is a capture surface, not a replacement for the AC store.

### KI-CG-001 — AC hooks are scoped to the git index, so parent-level drift is unreachable

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `templates/scripts/commit_guardian/check_ac_parent_covered_by.py:134-150`, and the AC hook family generally

**Symptom.** These hooks derive their file list from `git diff --cached --name-only` (or
`HOOK_TEST_FILES` under test) — never from the store. Any fact that is true of the store
but not of the staged set is structurally invisible. Because normal work edits children
and leaves the parent untouched, the parent is almost never staged, so the hooks that
exist to check parents are almost never handed one. Their silence reads as a pass; it
means they were not given the file.

**Evidence.** `ACD-400a` on `main` at `439b9076f` carries **both** failure modes at once:
`covered_by: [ACD-400a-1, ACD-400a-2]` while `ACD-400a-3` and `-4` have existed on disk
since 2026-08-12, and `work_status: done` while `ACD-400a-1` and `-2` are both still
`todo`. Every commit in that five-day window passed every AC hook. It surfaced only when
the parent was incidentally staged on 2026-08-18.

It is not an isolated record. A read-only sweep of all 3,146 store records at the same
commit found **20** composites marked `done` with at least one unfinished child —
`ACD-300a`, `ACD-400b` and `ACD-600a` each with 3-4 `todo` children. Sixteen are L2; in
thirteen of those, every unfinished child is a Roman-suffixed technical-constraint
sibling, so the dominant shape is flipping an L2 to `done` once its behaviour works while
its `-i` constraints stay `todo`.

Two aggravating details. These hooks fail open on unexpected exceptions, so an error is
also silent. And they ignore `argv`: passing a path on the command line does not make
them check that path, which makes them easy to "verify" without having verified anything.

**Fix direction.** For any staged AC, resolve and check its parent from the store whether
or not the parent is staged — the store is on disk and cheap to read. A store-wide sweep
in CI would also catch existing drift, which per-commit hooks by construction never will.
Until then, the workaround is documented in `CLAUDE.md` → "AC-store commits — stage the
parent alongside the child".

**Pattern:** `docs/reference/false-green-mechanisms.md` → M3.
