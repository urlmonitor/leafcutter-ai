# Known issues — ac-store

Observed defects in this component that are **not yet fixed**. This file exists so a
defect noticed in passing can be recorded in seconds, without authoring a full
acceptance criterion for something nobody has decided to build yet.

## How to use this file

**Read it before adding new capability to this component.** Fixing what is already
broken takes precedence over building more.

**Adding an issue.** Append a new `### KI-ACS-NNN` section using the next free number.
Nothing here is generated — edit it by hand. Fill in what you actually know; an issue
recorded with a thin `Evidence` line is far better than one not recorded.

**Hitting an existing issue.** Increment `Occurrences` and update `Last seen`. Do not
add a duplicate entry. Occurrences is an escalator, not the score — a blocker seen once
outranks an annoyance seen ten times.

**Severity** is `blocker` (work cannot land) / `high` (silent wrong behaviour) /
`medium` (real but survivable) / `low` (noise, dead code, cosmetics).

**Closing an issue.** When the fix lands, delete the section and reference the issue id
in the commit message. If it earns real work, author an AC for it and note the AC id in
`Status` — this file is a capture surface, not a replacement for the AC store.

### KI-ACS-001 — `validate_ac_schema.py` exits 0 when it validates nothing

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py:333`

**Symptom.** The script takes **file paths** and does no globbing of its own. Handed a
directory — the intuitive way to validate a component — it matches zero files, prints
`No YAML files to validate.` and **exits 0**. The caller sees a success-shaped result
from a run that checked nothing. A validator that cannot distinguish "clean" from "I was
given nothing" is worse than no validator, because it is consulted for reassurance.

**Evidence.** Verified 2026-08-18 against `docs/acceptance-criteria/testing-quality/`:
the bare-directory form prints the no-op message and exits 0, while
`find <dir> -name "*.yaml" -exec python scripts/ac_store/validate_ac_schema.py {} +`
over the same tree reports eight real violations (`documentation_triggers` present on L2
records, permitted only on L1). Across the whole store the correct invocation reports
**288** violations, most of them legacy list-form `it_requirements` predating the
object-form rule — real, but not a fire.

This mattered because `CLAUDE.md`'s own "AC-store hygiene — bulk pre-flight" section
prescribed the bare-directory form from 2026-08-10 until 2026-08-18, so the documented
defence against store rot was itself a no-op for eight days. That instruction is now
fixed; the script is not.

**Fix direction.** Exit non-zero, or at minimum warn loudly, when the resolved file count
is zero. Better: accept a directory and walk it, since that is plainly what every caller
means. Note a plain `*/*.yaml` glob is **not** an adequate workaround — AC YAML sits at
more than one depth, so a fixed-depth pattern silently skips directories, which is the
same defect wearing a different hat.

**Pattern:** `docs/reference/false-green-mechanisms.md` → M5.

### KI-ACS-002 — `--verify` passes `files_touched` on a path count, not on correctness

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open
- **Occurrences:** 1
- **First seen:** 2026-08-18 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/generate_ticket_from_ac.py` — the `--verify` readiness report

**Symptom.** The readiness report's surface check asserts only that *some* paths were
derived. Its output reads `[PASS] files_touched has N path(s) from doc_links` — N > 0 is
the whole test. An AC whose derived surface omits the file the work changes, and includes
a file the AC's own criteria forbid touching, passes it and the report concludes `READY`.
The provenance label is misleading too: paths that came from the prose fallback are
reported as coming from `doc_links`.

**Evidence.** `python scripts/ac_store/generate_ticket_from_ac.py --ac BO-2400g-2 --verify`
on `main` at `439b9076f` exits 0 and prints:

```
=== Ticket readiness report for BO-2400g-2: READY ===
  [PASS] files_touched has 4 path(s) from doc_links
```

The four paths are `scripts/build.py`, `templates/agents/change-scope-reviewer.md`,
`templates/agents/pr-reviewer.md` and `unit_tests/_workflow_engine_harness.py`. The file
that AC exists to change — `templates/workflows-js/fast-lane-ship.js` — is absent, because
its `doc_link` is tagged `describes`. `change-scope-reviewer.md` is a file that AC's
criteria explicitly forbid touching, and `scripts/build.py` came from the prose scan, not
from a `doc_link` at all.

This is the check people reach for when they want reassurance that a generated ticket is
sane, so a count dressed as a verdict is worse here than elsewhere.

**Fix direction.** Compare the derived surface against something independent — at minimum
warn when an AC has edit-surface `doc_links` for files that did not make the list, or when
a path arrived only via the prose fallback. Report provenance per path honestly. A check
that cannot assess correctness should report `INFO`, not `PASS`. Related: the prose
fallback itself is `BP-1100a-4`, and the authoring-side rule is documented in
`docs/how-to/ac-traceability-store.md`.

**Pattern:** `docs/reference/false-green-mechanisms.md` → M8.

### KI-ACS-003 — An AC is marked `done` with no link to the code implementing it

- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** open — no AC authored yet; the semantics question below is the reason
- **Occurrences:** 12
- **First seen:** 2026-08-17 · **Last seen:** 2026-08-18
- **Where:** `scripts/ac_store/mark_ac_done.py`; also reached from
  `scripts/build_orchestration/fast_lane.py` — `_update_ac_work_status`, used by
  `mark_done_built_acs`

**Symptom.** Every automated path to `work_status: done` is status-only. Nothing
writes `implemented_by`, so an AC can assert completion with no traceable link to the
code that satisfied it — the reader has no way to check the claim.

**Evidence.** TKT-600a-1 after its fast-lane build: `work_status: done`,
`implemented_by: []`; populated by hand in `b3124ff25`. Same gap on 2026-08-17 when
the BO-2400a-3 family was marked done via `mark_ac_done.py`, which also only sets
`work_status` — so this is not specific to the fast lane.

Reproduced ten more times on 2026-08-18 (PR #485). Every one of BO-2400f-4, its six
children, BO-2400f-11, and BO-2400c-1-ii/-iii/-iv was marked done through
`mark_ac_done.py --test-root`, passed the coverage gate, and landed with
`implemented_by: []`. All ten were filled in by hand in the same commit. The
count is what makes the shape clear: this is not an occasional miss, it is the
guaranteed outcome of every automated done-transition, and the only thing
currently preventing a store full of unprovenanced dones is somebody noticing.

Worth recording precisely because the gate did its job. Coverage was verified, a
passing covers-tagged test existed for each — so the failure is not "done was
claimed falsely", it is "done was claimed truthfully and left untraceable". It is a
sibling of KI-ACS-001 above rather than a duplicate: that one is a check reporting a
pass it did not earn, this one is a record omitting the evidence for a pass it did.

**Fix direction.** Write `implemented_by` at mark-done time from the evidence already
in hand (the coder phase reports `files_modified`; `done_proof` already resolves the
covering test). Note this is a **provenance-semantics decision, not a mechanical
one** — what `implemented_by` must contain for a claim of done to be trustworthy is
the owning question, and it should be settled here rather than in each call site.

**Provenance.** Originally recorded as KI-BO-002 in
`docs/known-issues/build-orchestration.md` because it was found during a fast-lane
run. Refiled here on 2026-08-18: the call site is in `fast_lane.py`, but the
semantics of `implemented_by` and of what "done" must prove belong to this
component, not to the lane that happens to invoke it. Renumbered from KI-ACS-001 to
KI-ACS-003 when this branch merged: `ac-store.md` was created independently on both
sides of the merge, and main's two entries had already taken 001 and 002.
